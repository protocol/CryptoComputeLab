## `CryptoComputeLab` üïπÔ∏è



### Mission & Vision

We strive to create and consume practical research to develop deployed software. 

Seeded by the hard problems Filecoin Mainnet presented, our long-term vision is to build on the solutions discovered and bring them to maturity. In this way, we will address a broader range of general problems, while discovering and overcoming new hard research development challenges along the way. Our aspiration is to harness this ongoing feedback loop to make ever more ambitious computational techniques practical for real-world applications. 

Please [join the discussion](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoComputeLab/discussions) to learn how you can work with us!

## Research

- Elliptic curve cryptography, applied and research

### Open Problems

We welcome discussion of our current Open Problems on our [github discussion page](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoComputeLab/discussions/categories/open-problems-ideas-proposals). 
  

### Projects 

Currently, the CryptoComputeLab is tasked with the following projects:

#### Filecoin Crypto

Responsible for the Proving system in Filecoin, the Filecoin Crypto project is a joint effort with other teams (such as Lotus) for maintaining and enhancing the Filecoin network.  Regular software updates are published as required with new functionality, bug fixes, performance enhancements, etc.

#### Lightweight Sector Upgrades

A current project that is ongoing is upgrading existing CC sectors with deal information to store user data.  At the moment, much of the storage committed to Filecoin is not readily available for deals, so this project aims to solve this.

#### Halo2

The current Proving system in Filecoin Crypto is based on Groth16, but we are currently evaluating switching to a recursive proving system using [Halo2](https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-releases-code-for-halo-2/).

#### Efficient Scheduler

The goal here is integrating a flexible work scheduler that allows better usage of limited resources, such as GPUs for completing the work of parts of the proving system.

#### Space VDF

The Space VDF project uses physical distance and the speed of light to help define the delay function.

#### GPGPU

Enhanced GPU support, primarily used in our proving system for accelerated computations.

### RFPs
  
 As we develop and post RFPs, they will be posted in [this github repo](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs).
  
### Collaborations
  
We are very interested in forming collaborations with researchers and engineers working in our fields of interest, and we offer several grants and research fellowships to support these working relationships. Please check out the [PL Research website](https://research.protocol.ai/outreach/) for further details and application instructions.
