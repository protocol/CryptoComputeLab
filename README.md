## `CryptoComputeLab` üïπÔ∏è



### Mission & Vision

We strive to create and consume practical research to develop deployed software. 

Seeded by the hard problems Filecoin Mainnet presented, our long-term vision is to build on the solutions discovered and bring them to maturity. In this way, we will address a broader range of general problems, while discovering and overcoming new hard research development challenges along the way. Our aspiration is to harness this ongoing feedback loop to make ever more ambitious computational techniques practical for real-world applications. 

Please [join the discussion](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoComputeLab/discussions) to learn how you can work with us!

### Open Problems

We welcome discussion of our [current Open Problems](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoComputeLab/tree/main/open_problems) on our [github discussion page](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoComputeLab/discussions/categories/open-problems-ideas-proposals). 
  

### Projects 

### RFPs
  
 As we develop and post RFPs, they will be posted in [this github repo](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs).
  
### Collaborations
  
We are very interested in forming collaborations with researchers and engineers working in our fields of interest, and we offer several grants and research fellowships to support these working relationships. Please check out the [PL Research website](https://research.protocol.ai/outreach/) for further details and application instructions.

Our current project partners include:
